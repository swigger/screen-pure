/*
 *  putenv  --  put value into environment
 *
 *  Usage:  i = putenv (string)
 *    int i;
 *    char  *string;
 *
 *  where string is of the form <name>=<value>.
 *  If "value" is 0, then "name" will be deleted from the environment.
 *  Putenv returns 0 normally, -1 on error (not enough core for malloc).
 *
 *  Putenv may need to add a new name into the environment, or to
 *  associate a value longer than the current value with a particular
 *  name.  So, to make life simpler, putenv() copies your entire
 *  environment into the heap (i.e. malloc()) from the stack
 *  (i.e. where it resides when your process is initiated) the first
 *  time you call it.
 *
 *  HISTORY
 *  3-Sep-91 Michael Schroeder (mlschroe). Modified to behave as
 *    as putenv.
 * 16-Aug-91 Tim MacKenzie (tym) at Monash University. Modified for
 *    use in screen (iScreen) (ignores final int parameter)
 * 14-Oct-85 Michael Mauldin (mlm) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *      Ripped out of CMU lib for Rob-O-Matic portability
 * 20-Nov-79  Steven Shafer (sas) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *    Created for VAX.  Too bad Bell Labs didn't provide this.  It's
 *    unfortunate that you have to copy the whole environment onto the
 *    heap, but the bookkeeping-and-not-so-much-copying approach turns
 *    out to be much hairier.  So, I decided to do the simple thing,
 *    copying the entire environment onto the heap the first time you
 *    call putenv(), then doing realloc() uniformly later on.
